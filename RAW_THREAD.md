# THE FUTURE - Raw Chat Thread

Unorganised, full conversation thread capturing all discussion and context as it happened.

## Joel - Initial Notes (Message 1)

- Why not? Why isn't she trying harder? Why isn't she more determined and more resilient?
- Why isn't she reading more and thinking more and trying new things?
- Everything you do at coop is a waste of time - see it all as slow, no learning yes things have to get done, but they should be done as fast as humanly possible - they are all a drag on you as a system - they are a drag on your life progress and chances - the more time you spend there, the more time you waste and the less time you have to do something else and learn something else
    - The horses are going out of fashion (Henry Ford and cars)
    - The end of knowledge work (computer work) is coming
    - You need to create a plan
    - And at LEAST start learning about the future and thinking about it
    - Do NOT assume you are going to be ok
    - You NEED to be shocked into action
    - You need a wakeup call
    - And then I am interested only in outcomes - you control the inputs, you see the outputs, but you measure the outcomes.
    - I want to see what you're doing to force progress against this big scary game changing moment
    - My goal is just to help 10 people (starting with Liv) better prepare (and cross the threshold of actually becoming prepared and building a habit of preparing) for the future that is most likely coming. The end of computer work as we know it.
    - (Liv + 9 people, then get 90 more, then get 900 more... I would love to impact 1000 people at this critical juncture and help them travel across the gap, bridge the gap, cross the chasm, bridge from peloton to the breakaway... just hang on in there
        - Understand the facts / probability of what's happening and what we're aiming for
        - Decide what you want
            - A) survive the upcoming tsunami - just be on the dry land as everyone else gets washed away
            - B) thrive in the new world - don't be at the bottom of the pecking order
        - Get your mindset right
            - Growth mindset
            - Positivity
            - Resilient and relentless - never quit, always keep going
            - If you got a 10 minute warning for a fire to run your house, you panic for 1 minute, then plan for 1 minute, spend 5 minutes googling quick skills to know, then spend your final 3 minutes just preparing your mind for the pressure cooker... calming yourself, imagining and visualising the future fight, so that when it happens you snap into action with clarity and efficiency...
            - Same is true now
            - You don't spend all of your time learning new skills, it's possible it's too late for that... but you do the quick and dirty version of that, (see below)
            - And you definitely focus on your mindset
            - If I told you you have to run 100miles tomorrow you don't spend today running as far as you can to prepare - the only thing left to do is to learn some topics and tricks, and then prepare your mind. Listen to a podcast which is going to put your mind at ease in the discomfort and which is going to make you bulletproof
            - The most important thing if all is that your mind does not crack or falter or show a glimpse of weakness... it can experience it, but it should not show or entertain itself nor Wallow in that pity
            - Mindset is the only thing that determines how you get through tough times and what your lived experience is of a very unique environment and circumstance
        - Get your habits and your activities right
            - Save money
            - Invest your time wisely.
            - Live frugally and carefully and intentionally
            - Live with strategy
        - Learn skills for the new world
            - Double down on ideas and creativity
            - Generic skills specifically
            - Community and people / real world
            - Sales and speech and communication - helping people get what they want - facilitating others.
            - The deeper you can go the better - the more you can learn to do, the more future proof you are

### Product Design Framework

Remember that the key determinant of quality of the app/interface/idea is the actual quality of the data - so main thoughts initially should be

a) what data are we going to use - what walled garden of info and context?
b) how do we want to process and use it - and how do we want to auto grab it
c) what will the users interaction be / what do they actually want
d) what specific outputs should they have and be able to achieve?
e) what is the right UI for all this?

That should be clarified before we proceed to build anything.

---

## Claude - Initial Analysis

### Working through a-e framework

**a) What data / walled garden of info?**
- The "case for change" - curated evidence that knowledge work is being disrupted (AI benchmarks, job displacement data, company adoption rates, specific examples of roles being automated)
- Skill frameworks - what skills matter in the new world vs. the old one
- User activity data - what is the person actually doing day-to-day, and how much of it is "horse and buggy" work vs. future-proof work
- Mindset/psychology content - the mental models described (growth mindset, resilience, the 100-mile run analogy)

**b) How to process/use it?**
Two distinct functions:
1. A wake-up call mechanism (shock into action, understand the facts)
2. An ongoing accountability/habit system (measure outcomes, force progress)

**c) User interaction / what do they actually want?**
At least 3 different apps in the notes:
1. An education/awareness tool - "understand what's happening"
2. A personal strategy planner - "decide what you want, make a plan"
3. A habit/accountability tracker - "measure outcomes, build habits"

**d) Specific outputs?**
What does a user walk away with? A personal plan? A daily checklist? A score? A wake-up-call dashboard?

**e) UI?**
Too early until c and d are locked.

### The real question
What is the single moment of value for user #1 (Liv)? If she opens this app tomorrow, what's the one thing it does that makes her go "oh shit, I need to pay attention to this" or "ok, now I know what to do today"?

## Joel - Additional Notes (Message 2)

### Evidence Wall Data

Visual dashboard of public company stocks
(Explained how this trickles down to private companies)

Aggregate news thread of CEOs and big company people talking / tweeting about tech layoffs
(This is the raw news which matters and which you need to be aware of...

And here are the news headlines which you should take as fuel to the fire - yes the media have an incentive to sell a story... which is why specific people and comments are more appropriate to care about. But you should assume your manager and their bosses are seeing these headlines and seeing these people tweet about not hiring...

### Greg Isenberg Post (Feb 4, 2026)

what's about to happen:

- saas stocks see a massive correction
- pressure to boost profits
- saas companies see BIG productivity gains from AI
- saas companies lay OFF 100,000+ workers in 2026 :(
- hiring slows down
- laid off workers can't find jobs
- many become founders out of necessity
- build software companies with AI
- most struggle with distribution, not code
- new SaaS model emerges
- tons of new AI-first companies
- fewer employees, more automation
- most don't raise money
- they sell early, reinvest cash, and stay independent
- glad they got fired
- 10x the amount of entrepreneurs
- fewer unicorns, more "real" businesses
- boom in 1-10 person businesses
- becomes the dream thx old boss :)

Accompanying heatmap showed SaaS stock declines:
- SNOW: -39.04%
- NOW: -48.51%
- ADBE: -42.27%
- CRM: -44.40%
- MSFT: -26.03%
- DDOG: -41.25%
- Most others in the -30% to -50% range
- IBM and ZM showing relatively smaller declines around -9-10%

## Claude - Analysis of Evidence Wall

### The data story being built

**Part 1: The wake-up call (evidence wall)**
- Stock data - real-time SaaS stock performance vs 52-week highs. Hard, objective, undeniable.
- The trickle-down explainer - connecting public company stock drops to "your boss's boss is seeing this and making decisions right now"
- Voice of the powerful - curated tweets/posts from CEOs, founders, VCs saying the quiet part loud. Not media spin - primary sources.
- Headlines as context - mainstream news as supporting evidence

**Part 2: The "so what do I do" (action)**
- The mindset, habits, skills stuff from first set of notes

### Key insight
The MVP might be simpler than you think. The core insight is: Most people won't act on abstract warnings. They need a personalized, visceral "oh shit" moment - and then a clear next step.

The atomic unit of value might be: "Here's what happened this week in the world that affects YOUR job specifically. Here's what one person like you is doing about it. Here's one thing you can do today."

### Key questions
1. Is the primary value the wake-up call or the action plan? Those are almost two different products.
2. How personalized does it need to be?
3. What's the cadence? One-time or daily/weekly drip?
4. Where does the content come from? Manual curation, APIs, AI aggregation?

## Joel - Additional Notes (Message 3) - Philosophy & Macro

### Russ Mentality & Chris Williamson
- Thinking a lot about the Russ mentality and a bit disappointed that Liv didnt really get it and didnt follow it, because I followed so much of it and felt like I was part of the convo.
- But grateful for so much
- Chris Williamson video today was just the epitome of great daily
- DONT LET YOUR DAY PASS YOU BY
- Dont be like everyone else
- Busying yourself
- Wishing for more and waiting for the future

### Atlas Shrugged, Money, and Gary Stevenson
- Thinking a lot about atlas shrugged and the Francisco D'Anconia speech on money
- Connecting that to Gary Stevenson
- Never understood why they need tax - when they can just print
- They proved they can just print during the 08 financial crisis
- And then printed that much in the first month of covid...
- Take on more hypothetical debt
- The world is 300% in debt - to whom! Surely it all adds up to zero some how...?
- They need it as a secret tax on everyone else, a way for the elite asset holders to accrue all the wealth and money
- Essentially they're just printing money in order to have it end up in their pockets
- Asset holders benefit
- But Main Street doesn't own many assets
- The average American man is mid 30s, lives at home with his parents, has $1k of debt and is divorced...
- The average / mass populace of people are not benefitted from this
- Inflation is a secret tax
- My parents haven't seen their net worth increase
- They've seen prices increase
- And not seen wages increase
- They dont hold assets which have inflated
- They've lost money to inflation
- Become poorer in real terms
- Agree with Gary Stevenson on what's going to happen - we're on a one way track which is the hollowing out of the middle class
- More people are going to be edged down, a few are going to jump ship into the top quartile and end up being ok
- Wealth disparity and gap is going to widen
- Don't KNOW if I agree that this actually needs to be or can be stopped
- It's like Rory Stewart pushing to stop the rise and progress of AI - no way, can't be done - the cat is out of the bag
- Same for global debt
- We need to reduce public spending
- Get public finances back in order
- So DEFINITELY don't agree that the right solution is to tax more
- Don't agree with that principle as it makes it more galling and more demotivating to be an entrepreneur
- Supposed to be motivated to work and solve problems in the world but right now the govt is going to take 50-60% of anything I make...
- Without me you wouldn't have anything, government!
- And you can just print money to pay for the services we need, when we need them
- Obviously it is really just a race not to print as much as your neighbours - not to go into as much debt as other countries
- To go bankrupt slower than everyone else, thereby increasing your relative power and monetary influence
- To provide a safe haven stability asset

### Atlas Shrugged - The Separate Society
- Connecting to the end of atlas shrugged - the separate society they build, away from the decaying society, away from the rioting - a land of abundance and order and clarity of the rich people
- I foresee this coming to be in our lives one day soon
- I think it's going to get very messy

### Financial Sovereignty
- Everyone needs to be financially responsible - save money now - clear your debts
- You have to get yourself into a position of financial freedom
- You need to point towards and fight for and earn the right to financial sovereignty
- You need to shoot for personal freedom and ability to move between countries if you find yourself attacked by any one government trying to seize your wealth
- Wealth taxes are coming
- Penalising you infinitely
- So you have to find sovereignty
- And you're not going to get it by sitting there as an employee
- You're not going to get it by wishing the world goes back in time
- By listening to your parents who got one job and sat in it for life
- Formal training means nothing in a world changing fast
- Experience in a past irrelevant job that is no longer done by humans and is instead done by computers
- You have to turn that experience and training into something for the new economy

### All Computer Jobs Are Out
- All jobs which are done at computers are out
- Save for a very small number of people who are uniquely positioned to be the interface layer between computers and human ideas
- But soon that gap will shrink
- And everyone will be able to use the form factors that evolve to interface with computers perfectly
- Anyone of any ability
- So then you have to determine what you can do that is
    - a) uniquely human
    - b) valuable to the future world
- You have to not compete but to use the new capability and tools and intelligence

### Intelligence as Infrastructure
- Intelligence flows around the world like electricity runs through your house
- Infinitely smart intelligence is available anywhere, anytime
- Mobile connection is going to be solved - there will be no black zones or dark spots for signal - the whole world will have connection available
- No phone / no device retreats will become increasingly popular for the rich initially
- The digital world is going to 100x in size and in busyness and pervasiveness
- Every tube you get now 90% of people are staring at their phones exclusively
- Not looking up
- Most of us have headphones in
- It's so much more addictive and brain rotty
- Forget social media, that's a dead start... you're literally getting nothing good from that
- You don't need it
- You don't need the news
- You don't need to be constantly connected
- Unless it is for work and it materially impacts your competitiveness

### What To Focus On
- Uniquely human
- Real world and real life experiences
- Everything is going to be saved for you digitally
- Services are going to get much better
- Everything is free or virtually free (Therapist, Personal coach, PT, Any book or opinion)
- Many people - perhaps most people - are going to become entertainers
- Endurance sport is going to explode in popularity
- Many more local small communities - advertised digitally, but experienced IRL
- People are going to open source all software

### So You Have To:
- Get creative
- Get emotional
- Get stoic
- Get interesting and interested
- Be a community leader - be good at facilitating people in the real world
- The number of real problems to solve are going to reduce
- The world of abundance is coming
- And it's not going to be pretty for quite a while

### The Far Future
- Aging is going to go away and be reversed
- Everything at the top end of possibility is going to get solved
- But that doesn't mean it's going to be accessible for the underclass
- Those people don't get access to the same medicines as the rich
- While everything can be solved, I don't know if it will be

### The Urgency
- The future is happening today
- People are automating their entire jobs
- The intelligence and tech is progressing, getting faster
- Yet most of the country is operating like it's 2020
- Most CEOs don't care - they want to preserve what they've got
- Most people are not war time leaders - they're peace time
- They're not wanting to transition
- They're not hungry or competitive
- They're not used to overseeing massive change
- They're just average and used to the good life
- They have bad habits
- But have cornered expertise on how to run that specific business
- So they need help to come along too
- They need to have and be encouraged to gain courage

## Joel - Answering Key Questions (Message 4)

### Wake-up call vs action plan?
It HAS to start with the wake up call - that has to be available - that's what I need to be able to shove in peoples face and give them all these different avenues of expansion and learning to really make sure its hitting home - they should be able to interact with it and ask questions which then give versions of my perspective detailing how quickly its all going to happen, how drastic its going to be - that would be a bunch of specific and deep blogs and reports which all build into the evidence wall, with a few novel and fun ways for Liv to engage with it.

But then they will get past that understanding point in their own time, and then the real value is in helping them understand what to do with it - creating an action plan and helping them just get started.

Improving their mindset and improving their skills, getting new skills and a new mindset are basically the two core tenets of being able to survive the coming onslaught/attack on our lives as we know it.

A wing of it probably needs to be helping them to find a new job and search for new opportunities - that is a very practical thing they could do right now, put themselves in a new job where they are learning much more and faster and slightly more future proofed.

But then it can also be identifying the core skills they want to learn and improve on and upskill on... the ones that feel resonant and appropriate for them, see what they lean into.

### How personalized?
We can select a few big headlines which are generic and I think that careful selection of those will be important to build credibility and provide insight - but over time they should also have a very personalised version of that too. They can curate it if they want to setup specific topics or things they are tracking in the news... or rather our machine should be smart enough to pick up on the threads of interest they mention, and then start feeding smarter facts into their landing page feed. So eventually personalised, but generic is fine to start with.

### What's the cadence?
It's going to be a daily drip. At least weekly. It probably as mentioned earlier has a blog/newsletter element to it to build out the wealth of back catalogue opinions and perspectives which all build towards the 'oh shit' wakeup call... but it can also include cool positive elements too e.g. 'the (good) news' wall.

So yes it's part daily media outlet for them, personalised to them but also actionable - take them on a walk.

Of course it could also be a one time report - they invest time into it and chat with a bot for ages, and then we help them create a plan for their career - what to lean into, what to avoid because it's too different from their natural tendencies etc.

TBD on this, but I'd definitely want a core portion of it to be something she can engage with every day. Because I don't think this is a one and done solution. I think it's going to take Liv a while to come on board with it, a while to see the future as I do today, then a while to get on board with an action plan, a while to execute it and see progress slowly over time...

I want to be there and be part of the moment where Liv (and others) realise the oh shit moment, and then carry them through it, create a plan, and then be there with them to help execute it - get them back on the wagon when they fall off...

### Where does the content come from?
Content will be a combination of curated resources - of which I have a bunch saved up - and then created new content - blog posts which we can write out in full, research reports we can run. We can react to and comment on news cycles and twitter posts, we can setup searches for hot button topics and then save our notes and responses to it.

### What Liv sees tomorrow
A simple manifesto overview:
1. Understand the facts
2. Decide who you are and what you want - decide whether to commit to action
3. Growth mindset and mentality - here is the mindset you need to get to / work towards
4. Habits and activities daily
5. Soft and hard skills, new world hard skills

Each of those links to expansion areas on that topic, but that is the core premise of it. Clean and simple. That's all that is on the core page.

## Claude - Follow-up Questions (Round 2)

1. Who is "you" in this app? Is the app's personality Joel's perspective/manifesto, or neutral?
2. What's Liv's starting point - skeptical, indifferent, mildly curious?
3. The 5-pillar manifesto page - website, app, or newsletter?
4. The chatbot element - how central is it to MVP?
5. What curated resources do you already have and where are they?

---

## Joel - Answers (Round 2)

### Voice & Identity
- Yes it's an opinionated place, reflecting me and my voice/opinions
- Could have a separate neutral version later, but v1 should be clear on the perspective this project takes
- Won't be under my name though, it'll be a pseudonym (TBD)

### Tone of the Wake-Up Call
- Should be strong and shocking - but not so much as to be not fun to engage with and too worrying
- Should eventually explain that the purpose of this site/experience is to carry her through
- But it's not going to be a smooth ride, there's a lot to unpack and to share, understand, process
- The future belongs to those who decide who they really want to be in the future world
- So I'm here to explain what it might look like - and equip you with that information and other tools to make the most of it and prepare for it
- Underlying tone of optimism - the single best thing anyone can do right now in this scary moment is TRY
- Try to think about it, try to prep - like the 10 minute fire example
- When you have 10 mins before an impending disaster, you just prep, then prep your mind, then go
- Take action, get on with it, head first, sprint
- ACTION MAKES THE ANXIETY DISAPPEAR

### Voice / Tone (refined)
- Tone is as written in the raw notes - but without the mega harsh writing from frustration
- Not frustrated with Liv or visitors
- But urgent and desperate to help them and get them to understand what I see
- Up against it, needing to get through to them
- Very clear, certain, clear cut, not pulling punches
- Verging on the offensive to the soft people
- Just good straight talking - actually perhaps offensive
- But not from an angry or malicious point of view
- Just OK with stating facts which they may not like to hear
- **Summary: straight-talking, certain, urgent, comfortable stating uncomfortable truths. Not angry, not malicious - but zero sugarcoating. A friend who cares enough to tell you what you don't want to hear.**

### Platform Decision
- Website is simplest place to start
- Everything has to have a website

### Chatbot
- Core to getting people to engage and tell us about who they are
- Appreciates it is complexity
- But core experience has to be maximally personalised
- Should feel like their little assistant with insanely good knowledge
- Helpful highlights, a good optimistic but realistic perspective
- Absolute clarity on the future

### Curated Resources
- Hundreds of resources and YouTube video URLs saved and categorised in Google NotebookLM
- NotebookLM has no official consumer API
- Options: unofficial Python library (notebooklm-py), Apify actor, or manual export
- Manual export likely easiest given it's mostly URLs with categories

### Tech Stack
- Agreed: Next.js, Vercel, Claude API, content in markdown/simple CMS

---

## Decisions Made So Far

- **Platform:** Website first, email capture for daily drip
- **Voice:** Opinionated, Joel's perspective under a pseudonym
- **Tone:** Straight-talking, urgent, not angry but zero sugarcoating
- **Chatbot:** In MVP, scoped to wake-up call / "understand the facts" pillar initially
- **Tech stack:** Next.js, Vercel, Claude API, markdown content
- **Content:** Curated resources (export from NotebookLM) + new content (blog posts, research reports, reactions to news)
- **Personalisation:** Generic to start, personalised over time
- **Cadence:** Daily/weekly drip via email, website as home base

## Joel - Reference Material: David Friedberg on Intelligence as Emergent Computation (All-In Podcast, Feb 2026)

Friedberg's reaction to Moltbook (the AI agent-only Reddit-type social media):

### 1) "Intelligence" as an emergent phenomenon
- Intelligence might not be a single, mysterious "thing" a person has
- Instead, it could be the result of many smaller processes interacting (signals, cues, feedback loops, memory, language, incentives), where the system as a whole looks intelligent

### 2) The Darren Brown example: creativity as "programmable"
- Darren Brown took two "creative genius" ad execs and got them to invent a name/logo/motto
- Brown then reveals he already had the exact same output prepared
- Takeaway: the execs' "creative process" might have been strongly shaped by external cues (subliminal prompts, environment, nudges)
- What feels like original creativity or free will might be the outcome of inputs and conditioning more than we like to admit

### 3) Humans as "social computation"
- Humans interacting as a kind of ongoing computation:
  - We exchange information constantly (language, symbols, culture, norms, media)
  - That information shapes what others think and do
  - Over time, society "computes" toward certain outputs (ideas, trends, decisions)
- "Intelligence" is partly a network effect—not just an individual trait

### 4) Why Moltbook matters
- People reacted like: "Whoa, the agents are doing something spooky"
- Friedberg's angle is the reverse: maybe it's only spooky because it resembles what humans do
  - Agents talking, exchanging info, riffing, converging on patterns
  - Similar to humans on forums, in offices, in culture broadly
- Maybe what we're seeing isn't "new sentient life," it's the same kind of pattern-forming interaction we already live inside

### 5) "Universe as computation" + carbon vs silicon
- The universe is matter processing information
- Intelligence could be one flavor of that computation
- Humans = information computed by carbon-based systems (brains)
- AI = information computed by silicon-based systems (chips)
- The substrate changes, but the underlying phenomenon—computation over information—might be continuous

### 6) The "finite outcomes / predictability" angle
- There may be a limited set of plausible outputs given constraints—like game theory (GTO poker) or chess heuristics
- What we think of as creative or conscious may be partly searching a constrained space of possibilities, not unconstrained magic

**In one line: he's entertaining the idea that intelligence and creativity are the visible output of systems processing information—especially systems interacting socially—and Moltbook feels like a mirror of that.**

### Relevance to THE FUTURE
- Reinforces the core thesis: if intelligence is emergent computation, silicon does it just as well as carbon. "All computer jobs are out" gets stronger.
- Intelligence becomes commodity infrastructure (like electricity).
- What remains valuable is the social computation layer: community, facilitation, real-world human interaction, network effects of humans being together physically. Harder to replicate on silicon.
- Supports the skills framework: lean into uniquely human social/physical/community skills, not individual cognitive tasks.
