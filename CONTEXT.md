# THE FUTURE - Core Background Context

All raw notes and thinking behind this project.

## 1. The Origin - Why This Exists

- Why not? Why isn't she trying harder? Why isn't she more determined and more resilient?
- Why isn't she reading more and thinking more and trying new things?
- Everything you do at coop is a waste of time - see it all as slow, no learning yes things have to get done, but they should be done as fast as humanly possible - they are all a drag on you as a system - they are a drag on your life progress and chances - the more time you spend there, the more time you waste and the less time you have to do something else and learn something else
    - The horses are going out of fashion (Henry Ford and cars)
    - The end of knowledge work (computer work) is coming
    - You need to create a plan
    - And at LEAST start learning about the future and thinking about it
    - Do NOT assume you are going to be ok
    - You NEED to be shocked into action
    - You need a wakeup call
    - And then I am interested only in outcomes - you control the inputs, you see the outputs, but you measure the outcomes.
    - I want to see what you're doing to force progress against this big scary game changing moment

## 2. The Mission

My goal is just to help 10 people (starting with Liv) better prepare (and cross the threshold of actually becoming prepared and building a habit of preparing) for the future that is most likely coming. The end of computer work as we know it.

Liv + 9 people, then get 90 more, then get 900 more... I would love to impact 1000 people at this critical juncture and help them travel across the gap, bridge the gap, cross the chasm, bridge from peloton to the breakaway... just hang on in there.

## 3. The Framework For Users

### Understand the facts / probability of what's happening and what we're aiming for

### Decide what you want
- A) survive the upcoming tsunami - just be on the dry land as everyone else gets washed away
- B) thrive in the new world - don't be at the bottom of the pecking order

### Get your mindset right
- Growth mindset
- Positivity
- Resilient and relentless - never quit, always keep going
- If you got a 10 minute warning for a fire to run your house, you panic for 1 minute, then plan for 1 minute, spend 5 minutes googling quick skills to know, then spend your final 3 minutes just preparing your mind for the pressure cooker... calming yourself, imagining and visualising the future fight, so that when it happens you snap into action with clarity and efficiency...
- Same is true now
- You don't spend all of your time learning new skills, it's possible it's too late for that... but you do the quick and dirty version of that, (see below)
- And you definitely focus on your mindset
- If I told you you have to run 100 miles tomorrow you don't spend today running as far as you can to prepare - the only thing left to do is to learn some topics and tricks, and then prepare your mind. Listen to a podcast which is going to put your mind at ease in the discomfort and which is going to make you bulletproof
- The most important thing of all is that your mind does not crack or falter or show a glimpse of weakness... it can experience it, but it should not show or entertain itself nor wallow in that pity
- Mindset is the only thing that determines how you get through tough times and what your lived experience is of a very unique environment and circumstance

### Get your habits and your activities right
- Save money
- Invest your time wisely
- Live frugally and carefully and intentionally
- Live with strategy

### Learn skills for the new world
- Double down on ideas and creativity
- Generic skills specifically
- Community and people / real world
- Sales and speech and communication - helping people get what they want - facilitating others
- The deeper you can go the better - the more you can learn to do, the more future proof you are

## 4. The Evidence Wall - Wake Up Call Data

### Stock Dashboard
- Visual dashboard of public company stocks
- Explained how this trickles down to private companies

### Voices of the Powerful
- Aggregate news thread of CEOs and big company people talking / tweeting about tech layoffs
- This is the raw news which matters and which you need to be aware of
- Specific people and comments are more appropriate to care about than media headlines
- You should assume your manager and their bosses are seeing these headlines and seeing these people tweet about not hiring

### Example: Greg Isenberg Post (Feb 4, 2026)

What's about to happen:

- SaaS stocks see a massive correction
- Pressure to boost profits
- SaaS companies see BIG productivity gains from AI
- SaaS companies lay OFF 100,000+ workers in 2026
- Hiring slows down
- Laid off workers can't find jobs
- Many become founders out of necessity
- Build software companies with AI
- Most struggle with distribution, not code
- New SaaS model emerges
- Tons of new AI-first companies
- Fewer employees, more automation
- Most don't raise money
- They sell early, reinvest cash, and stay independent
- Glad they got fired
- 10x the amount of entrepreneurs
- Fewer unicorns, more "real" businesses
- Boom in 1-10 person businesses
- Becomes the dream thx old boss :)

Accompanying heatmap showed SaaS stock declines:
- SNOW: -39.04%
- NOW: -48.51%
- ADBE: -42.27%
- CRM: -44.40%
- MSFT: -26.03%
- DDOG: -41.25%
- Most others in the -30% to -50% range
- IBM and ZM showing relatively smaller declines around -9-10%

## 5. The Bigger Picture - Macro & Philosophy

### Thinking about Russ mentality
- A lot about the Russ mentality and disappointed that Liv didn't really get it and didn't follow it, because I followed so much of it and felt like I was part of the convo.
- But grateful for so much

### Chris Williamson
- Video today was just the epitome of great daily
- DONT LET YOUR DAY PASS YOU BY
- Don't be like everyone else
- Busying yourself
- Wishing for more and waiting for the future

### Atlas Shrugged & Francisco D'Anconia's Speech on Money
- Connecting that to Gary Stevenson
- I've never understood why they need tax - when they can just print
- They proved they can just print during the 08 financial crisis
- And then printed that much in the first month of covid...
- Take on more hypothetical debt
- The world is 300% in debt - to whom! Surely it all adds up to zero some how...?
- They need it as a secret tax on everyone else, a way for the elite asset holders to accrue all the wealth and money
- Essentially they're just printing money in order to have it end up in their pockets
- Asset holders benefit
- But Main Street doesn't own many assets
- The average American man is mid 30s, lives at home with his parents, has $1k of debt and is divorced...
- The average / mass populace of people are not benefitted from this
- Inflation is a secret tax
- My parents haven't seen their net worth increase
- They've seen prices increase
- And not seen wages increase
- They don't hold assets which have inflated
- They've lost money to inflation
- Become poorer in real terms

### The Hollowing Out of the Middle Class
- I agree with Gary Stevenson on what's going to happen - we're on a one way track which is the hollowing out of the middle class
- More people are going to be edged down, a few are going to jump ship into the top quartile and end up being ok
- Wealth disparity and gap is going to widen
- I don't KNOW if I agree that this actually needs to be or can be stopped
- It's like Rory Stewart pushing to stop the rise and progress of AI - no way, can't be done - the cat is out of the bag
- Same for global debt
- We need to reduce public spending
- Get public finances back in order
- So I DEFINITELY don't agree that the right solution is to tax more
- I don't agree with that principle as it makes it more galling and more demotivating to be an entrepreneur
- Supposed to be motivated to work and solve problems in the world but right now the govt is going to take 50-60% of anything I make...
- Without me you wouldn't have anything, government!
- And you can just print money to pay for the services we need, when we need them
- Obviously it is really just a race not to print as much as your neighbours - not to go into as much debt as other countries
- To go bankrupt slower than everyone else, thereby increasing your relative power and monetary influence
- To provide a safe haven stability asset

### Atlas Shrugged - The Separate Society
- Connecting to the end of Atlas Shrugged - the separate society they build, away from the decaying society, away from the rioting - a land of abundance and order and clarity of the rich people
- I foresee this coming to be in our lives one day soon
- I think it's going to get very messy

## 6. What Everyone Needs To Do - Financial Sovereignty

- Everyone needs to be financially responsible - save money now - clear your debts
- You have to get yourself into a position of financial freedom
- You need to point towards and fight for and earn the right to financial sovereignty
- You need to shoot for personal freedom and ability to move between countries if you find yourself attacked by any one government trying to seize your wealth
- Wealth taxes are coming
- Penalising you infinitely
- So you have to find sovereignty
- And you're not going to get it by sitting there as an employee
- You're not going to get it by wishing the world goes back in time
- By listening to your parents who got one job and sat in it for life
- Formal training means nothing in a world changing fast
- Experience in a past irrelevant job that is no longer done by humans and is instead done by computers
- You have to turn that experience and training into something for the new economy

---

## 7. The Nature of the Change

### All computer jobs are out
- All jobs which are done at computers are out
- Save for a very small number of people who are uniquely positioned to be the interface layer between computers and human ideas
- But soon that gap will shrink
- And everyone will be able to use the form factors that evolve to interface with computers perfectly
- Anyone of any ability

### What you must determine
- a) What can you do that is uniquely human?
- b) What is valuable to the future world?
- You have to not compete but to use the new capability and tools and intelligence

### Intelligence becomes infrastructure
- Intelligence flows around the world like electricity runs through your house
- Infinitely smart intelligence is available anywhere, anytime
- Mobile connection is going to be solved - there will be no black zones or dark spots for signal - the whole world will have connection available

### The digital world explodes
- No phone / no device retreats will become increasingly popular for the rich initially who find that forcing themselves to go away and go to a black spot is the only way to disconnect from the online world and the forcing function is the only way to truly connect with nature and to find themselves
- The digital world is going to 100x in size and in busyness and pervasiveness
- You already see a shift in the past few years
    - Every tube you get now 90% of people (myself included) are staring at their phones exclusively
    - Not looking up
    - Most of us have headphones in
    - And yes it's not the biggest shift - it's just gone from carcinogenic ink newspapers to brain rot moving bright lights in front of our face...
    - But it's so much more addictive and brain rotty
    - It's really hard now to keep yourself away from being sucked into it all in some angle
    - Forget social media, that's a dead start... you're literally getting nothing good from that
    - And you don't need it
    - You don't need the news
    - You don't need to be constantly connected
    - Unless it is for work and it materially impacts your competitiveness against others using tech and doing the same thing as you
    - Which will increasingly be more people
    - And everyone

### What to focus on
- Uniquely human
- Real world and real life experiences
- Everything is going to be saved for you digitally
- Services are going to get much better
- Everything is free or virtually free
    - Therapist
    - Personal coach
    - PT
    - Any book or opinion (you'll still pay for your factories)

### What most people will do
- Many people - perhaps most people - are going to become entertainers
- The only thing left to do with their time is to film themselves doing funny or interesting things
- To try and compete to gain just a little bit of attention
- Endurance sport - self opted in difficulty and hardship... is going to explode in popularity
- So much more sports
- So much more entertainment
- Which means so much more competition for me to watch your entertainment channel and not anyone else's
- Many more local small communities - advertised digitally, but experienced IRL

### Open source everything
- People are going to open source all software
- Again because it's the only way they can compete for any attention...

### So you have to:
- Get creative
- Get emotional
- Get stoic
- Get interesting and interested
- Be a community leader - be good at facilitating people in the real world
- The number of real problems to solve are going to reduce - they're going to slowly get moved
- The world of abundance is coming
- And it's not going to be pretty
- For quite a while

### The far future
- Aging is going to go away and be reversed...
- New challenges will need to be solved yes - things we can't imagine right now
- But everything at the top end of possibility is going to get solved
- But that doesn't mean that it's going to be accessible for the underclass
- The under world
- The people below the threshold of affluence and money and power
- Those people don't get access to the same medicines as the rich
- So actually while everything can be solved, I don't know if it will be... will it result in less poverty... surely?
- But maybe not
- What then
- How are you preparing for this future

## 8. The Urgency - It's Happening Now

- The future is happening today
- People are automating their entire jobs
- People are speaking to their computers and phones and things just happen
- The intelligence and tech is progressing
- It's getting faster
- Yet most of the country is operating like it's 2020...
- Most CEOs don't care - they want to preserve what they've got
- Most people are not war time leaders - they're peace time
- Yes leaders have done something right to rise to the top
- But they're not wanting to transition
- They don't want to be on the forefront
- They're not hungry
- They're not competitive
- They're not used to overseeing massive change
- They're not
- They're just average
- And they're used to the good life
- They're not working that hard
- They're used to a life of golf and nice dinners
- They're fat and overweight and don't take care of themselves
- They have bad habits
- But have cornered expertise on how to run that specific business in their world in their part
- So they need help to come along too
- They need to have and be encouraged to gain courage...

## 9. Product Design Framework

Remember that the key determinant of quality of the app/interface/idea is the actual quality of the data - so main thoughts initially should be:

a) **What data are we going to use** - what walled garden of info and context?
b) **How do we want to process and use it** - and how do we want to auto grab it?
c) **What will the user's interaction be** / what do they actually want?
d) **What specific outputs** should they have and be able to achieve?
e) **What is the right UI** for all this?

That should be clarified before we proceed to build anything.
