# THE FUTURE

Helping people prepare for the end of knowledge work as we know it.

---

## What Is This?

A website that does two things:

1. **Wakes you up.** The evidence wall - stock data, CEO quotes, headlines - that makes the coming disruption of knowledge work undeniable. Not media spin. Primary sources. Hard data.

2. **Helps you act.** A 5-pillar framework for preparing: understand the facts, decide what you want, fix your mindset, build the right habits, learn the right skills.

Wrapped in an AI chatbot that answers your questions in the author's voice - straight-talking, certain, uncomfortable truths delivered without sugarcoating but with underlying optimism. Because the single best thing you can do right now is try.

## The Thesis

All jobs done at computers are going away. Not eventually. Now. SaaS stocks are down 30-50%. CEOs are tweeting about not hiring. Companies are seeing massive AI productivity gains and laying people off.

Most people are operating like it's 2020. They shouldn't be.

The future belongs to those who decide who they want to be in the new world - and start preparing now. This site exists to grab you by the shoulders, show you the evidence, and then walk with you as you figure out what to do about it.

## The 5 Pillars

1. **Understand the facts** - the evidence wall, the data, the voices of the powerful
2. **Decide who you are** - survive or thrive? Commit to action.
3. **Get your mindset right** - growth mindset, resilience, stoicism. Your mind cannot crack.
4. **Get your habits right** - save money, invest time wisely, live with strategy
5. **Learn new skills** - creativity, community, communication, facilitation. Uniquely human. Valuable in the future world.

## Key Decisions

- **Platform:** Website first, email capture for daily drip
- **Voice:** Opinionated, author's perspective under a pseudonym (TBD)
- **Tone:** Straight-talking, urgent, comfortable stating uncomfortable truths. Not angry or malicious - just zero sugarcoating.
- **Chatbot:** In MVP from day one, scoped to "understand the facts" pillar initially
- **Personalisation:** Generic to start, personalised over time as the system learns what users care about
- **Cadence:** Daily/weekly email drip, website as home base
- **Content:** Curated resources (hundreds saved in NotebookLM) + new content (blog posts, research reports, news reactions)

## Mission

Start with 1 person (Liv). Then 10. Then 100. Then 1,000.

Help them cross the gap. Bridge from the peloton to the breakaway. Carry them through the wake-up call, create a plan, and stay with them as they execute it. Get them back on the wagon when they fall off.

Action makes the anxiety disappear.
